# Release Gates

This document explores the concept of **release gates** in Azure DevOps, their purpose, and how they enhance control, security, and governance in deployment pipelines.

---

## **Overview**
- **Release Gates**: Conditions that must be satisfied for a deployment to proceed (pre-deployment gates) or to be considered successful (post-deployment gates).
- **Purpose**: To automate and streamline approval processes, reduce manual intervention, and ensure compliance with security, quality, and governance standards.

---

## **Key Benefits of Release Gates**
1. **Streamlined Processes**:
   - Reduces the need for manual intervention or dependency meetings.
   - Stakeholders can approve deployments with a single click, saving time and effort.

2. **Automation**:
   - Leverages scripts and APIs to automate approvals and provide data-driven assessments.
   - Extends beyond manual approvals to ensure objective validation.

3. **Granular Control**:
   - Provides pre-deployment and post-deployment checks to ensure compliance with security, quality, and governance standards.

## **Use Cases for Release Gates**

### 1. **Incident and Issues Management**
   - Ensures deployment proceeds only if specific conditions are met (e.g., no active software bugs or unresolved incidents).

### 2. **Approval Integration with Collaboration Systems**
   - Integrates with platforms like **Microsoft Teams** or **Slack** to communicate with stakeholders and await their approval before proceeding.

### 3. **Quality Validation**
   - Queries metrics from tests (e.g., pass rate, code coverage) and ensures deployment occurs only if thresholds are met.

### 4. **Security Scans on Artifacts**
   - Verifies completion of security scans (e.g., anti-virus checks, code signing, policy validation) before deployment.

### 5. **User Experience Monitoring**
   - Uses product telemetry to validate that the user experience meets baseline standards and prevents deployment if regression is detected.

### 6. **Change Management Integration**
   - Waits for change management procedures (e.g., in **ServiceNow**) to conclude before proceeding with deployment.

### 7. **Infrastructure Health Checks**
   - Post-deployment, validates infrastructure compliance with predefined rules (e.g., resource utilization, security standards).

## **Types of Release Gates**
1. **Pre-Deployment Gates**:
   - Conditions that must be met before deployment begins.
   - Examples: Security scans, quality validation, stakeholder approvals.

2. **Post-Deployment Gates**:
   - Conditions that must be met for the deployment to be considered successful.
   - Examples: Infrastructure health checks, user experience monitoring.

## **Manual vs. Automated Approvals**
- **Manual Approvals**:
   - Useful for environments requiring additional scrutiny.
   - Allows stakeholders to pause, resume, or reject deployments.

- **Automated Approvals**:
   - Expedites deployments by automating checks and validations.
   - Ensures compliance with security, quality, and governance standards.

## **Key Takeaways for AZ-400 Exam**
1. **Understand the Purpose of Release Gates**:
   - To automate and streamline approval processes while ensuring compliance with security, quality, and governance standards.

2. **Scenario-Based Questions**:
   - Be prepared to identify when to use pre-deployment vs. post-deployment gates.
   - Understand how release gates integrate with collaboration tools, security scans, and change management systems.

3. **Integration with Deployment Pipelines**:
   - Release gates are a critical part of deployment pipelines, providing granular control over the release process.
