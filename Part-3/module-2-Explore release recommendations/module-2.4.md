# Using Release Gates to Protect Quality

This document explains how **quality gates** can be used to enforce quality policies in your organization and automate quality checks as part of the release pipeline.

---

## **Overview**
- **Quality Gates**: Conditions that determine whether an application can be delivered to production.
- **Purpose**: To enforce quality policies and ensure that only high-quality software is released.
- **Automation**: Quality gates can be automated as part of the release pipeline to eliminate manual bottlenecks.

## **Key Concepts**

### **What is a Quality Gate?**
- A checkpoint that validates whether the application meets predefined quality standards before moving to the next stage.
- Traditionally managed by QA teams through manual checks, but in **Continuous Delivery (CD)**, these checks are automated.

### **Why Automate Quality Gates?**
- Manual quality checks are a potential bottleneck in CD pipelines.
- Automation ensures consistent and objective validation of quality policies.
- Speeds up the release process while maintaining high-quality standards.

## **Examples of Quality Gates**
Here are some common quality gates that can be automated:

1. **No New Blocker Issues**:
   - Ensures no critical or blocker issues are present in the release.

2. **Code Coverage**:
   - Validates that code coverage for new code is above a specified threshold (e.g., 80%).

3. **License Compliance**:
   - Ensures no license violations are introduced in the codebase.

4. **Security Vulnerabilities**:
   - Checks for vulnerabilities in dependencies or the application itself.

5. **Technical Debt**:
   - Ensures no additional technical debt is introduced in the release.

6. **Performance Checks**:
   - Validates that the performance of the application is not negatively impacted.

7. **Compliance Checks**:
   - Ensures the release complies with organizational or regulatory policies.

8. **Work Items Linked to Release**:
   - Verifies that all work items (e.g., bugs, features) are linked to the release.

9. **Approval by Independent Party**:
   - Ensures the release is initiated by someone other than the code committer (e.g., four-eyes principle).

## **Benefits of Quality Gates**
1. **Enforces Quality Policies**:
   - Ensures that only high-quality software is released to production.

2. **Automates Manual Checks**:
   - Reduces bottlenecks and speeds up the release process.

3. **Improves Consistency**:
   - Provides objective and consistent validation of quality standards.

4. **Enhances Compliance**:
   - Ensures compliance with organizational and regulatory requirements.
