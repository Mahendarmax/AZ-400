## **Overview**
- **Release Gates**: Conditions that must be met before or after a deployment to ensure application health and compliance.
- **Purpose**: To automate and enforce quality checks, approvals, and monitoring during the release process.
- **Use Case**: Deploy updates in a phased manner (e.g., Canary deployment) and ensure no blocking bugs or active alerts before promoting the release.

---

## **Lab Scenario**
- **Objective**: Configure a release pipeline with two environments (e.g., Canary and Production) for an Azure Web App.
- **Key Requirements**:
  1. Deploy to the **Canary environment** only if there are no blocking bugs.
  2. Mark the **Canary environment** as complete only if there are no active alerts in **Application Insights** (Azure Monitor).

## **Key Concepts**

### **Release Pipelines**
- Define the end-to-end release process for deploying applications across multiple environments.
- Deployments are automated using jobs and tasks.

### **Approvals and Gates**
- **Approvals**: Manual or automated checks to control the start and completion of deployments.
- **Gates**: Automated checks that ensure specific criteria (e.g., no active alerts, no blocking bugs) are met before proceeding.

### **Pre-Deployment and Post-Deployment Gates**
- **Pre-Deployment Gates**: Ensure conditions are met before deploying to an environment (e.g., no active issues in work items).
- **Post-Deployment Gates**: Ensure conditions are met after deployment (e.g., no incidents in monitoring systems).

## **Types of Gates**
1. **Invoke Azure Function**:
   - Triggers an Azure Function and ensures successful completion.

2. **Query Azure Monitor Alerts**:
   - Checks for active alerts in Azure Monitor.

3. **Invoke REST API**:
   - Makes a call to a REST API and continues if it returns a successful response.

4. **Query Work Items**:
   - Ensures the number of matching work items returned from a query is within a specified threshold.
