# Task Groups in Azure DevOps

## Overview
Task Groups allow you to encapsulate a sequence of tasks (from a build or release pipeline) into a single reusable task. They help standardize and centrally manage deployment steps across multiple pipelines.

## Key Features
- **Reusability:** Encapsulate a set of tasks into a single reusable task.
- **Parameterization:** Extract parameters from tasks and expose them as configuration variables.
- **Centralized Management:** Changes to a task group are automatically reflected in all pipelines using it.
- **Standardization:** Ensures consistent deployment and build processes across applications.

## Limitations
- **Not Supported in YAML Pipelines:** Use templates instead for YAML pipelines.

## Use Cases
- **Standard Deployment Steps:** Encapsulate common tasks like deploying to Azure App Service.
- **Build Process Standardization:** Standardize steps like code compilation, testing, and artifact publishing.
- **Centralized Updates:** Update a common process (e.g., tool version) in one place, and it propagates to all pipelines.

## How to Create and Use Task Groups
### Create a Task Group:
1. In Azure DevOps, select a sequence of tasks in a pipeline.
2. Right-click and choose **Create Task Group**.
3. Define parameters and save the task group.

### Use a Task Group:
1. Add the task group to any pipeline.
2. Configure parameters as needed.

## Task Groups vs. Templates
| Feature         | Task Groups            | Templates            |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Pipeline Type** | Classic (UI-based) pipelines | YAML pipelines |
| **Reusability** | Yes | Yes |
| **Parameterization** | Yes | Yes |
| **Centralized Updates** | Changes propagate automatically | Requires updating the template |

## Best Practices
- **Use Descriptive Names:** Name task groups clearly (e.g., "Deploy to Azure App Service").
- **Parameterize Wisely:** Expose only necessary parameters to avoid complexity.
- **Versioning:** Create new versions of task groups when making significant changes.
- **Documentation:** Document the purpose, parameters, and usage of the task group.

## Exam Tips
- **Key Concepts:** Understand the purpose, benefits, and limitations of task groups.
- **Scenario-Based Questions:** Be prepared for questions like:
  - "How can you standardize deployment steps across multiple pipelines?"
  - "What should you use instead of task groups in YAML pipelines?"
- **Key Terminology:** Task groups, templates, parameterization, centralized management.
