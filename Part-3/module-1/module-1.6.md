# Custom Build and Release Tasks

## Overview
Custom tasks are user-created units of executable code for build and release pipelines in Azure DevOps. They can replace out-of-the-box tasks, command-line scripts, or shell scripts, providing enhanced flexibility and control.

## Advantages of Custom Tasks

- **Access to Variables**: Use variables not available in standard tasks.
- **Secure Endpoints**: Safely connect to target servers without exposing credentials.
- **Reusability**: Share tasks across multiple projects and teams.
- **Abstraction**: Hide implementation details from end users, simplifying pipeline configurations.

## Key Points to Remember

- **Tasks Automate Repeatable Actions**: Tasks help streamline build and release processes.
- **Build Tasks**: Focus on compiling, testing, and packaging applications.
- **Release Tasks**: Handle deployment and post-deployment activities.
- **Marketplace Support**: Additional tasks can be downloaded for extended functionality.
- **Flexibility & Control**: Custom tasks enable fine-grained control over build and deployment workflows.
- **Sharing Options**: Custom tasks can be shared privately within an organization or publicly.
- **Ideal for Complex Requirements**: Useful for organizations with unique automation needs.

## Key Takeaways

- Tasks are essential for automating build and release processes.
- Pre-built or community tasks save time and effort.
- Custom tasks cater to unique requirements, enhancing automation.
- They improve security, reusability, and efficiency.
- Users interact with task functionalities without needing to understand internal implementation details.

## Getting Started

1. **Create a Custom Task**:
   - Define the task in a JSON manifest (`task.json`).
   - Write the execution logic in PowerShell, Bash, or Node.js.
   - Package the task as an extension.

2. **Install the Task**:
   - Upload the task to your Azure DevOps organization.
   - Add it to the pipeline YAML or Classic Editor.

3. **Use the Task**:
   - Reference the task in your build or release pipeline.
   - Configure inputs and variables as needed.

## Example YAML Usage

```yaml
steps:
  - task: CustomTask@1
    inputs:
      parameter1: value1
      parameter2: value2
```
