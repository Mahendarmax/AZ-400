# Build and Release Tasks

## Overview
Tasks are units of executable code used to perform specific actions in a build or release pipeline. They define the steps for building, testing, packaging, and deploying applications.

## Build Tasks
Build tasks are used to specify actions such as:
- Building the application.
- Running tests.
- Packaging the application.

These steps can include utilities, scripts, and deployment tasks to automate the build process.

## Release Tasks
Release tasks are used to deploy the application to various environments (e.g., Dev, QA, Production). These tasks can include:
- Configuration settings.
- Validation steps.
- Post-deployment checks.

## Custom and Community Tasks
If a required task isnâ€™t available out-of-the-box, you can:
- Use community-contributed tasks from marketplaces (e.g., Jenkins, Azure DevOps, Atlassian).
- Create custom tasks to meet specific needs.

## Key Points to Remember
- Tasks automate repeatable actions in build and release pipelines.
- Build tasks focus on compiling, testing, and packaging applications.
- Release tasks focus on deployment and post-deployment activities.
- Marketplaces offer additional tasks for extended functionality.

## Key Takeaways
- Tasks are essential for automating build and release processes.
- Use pre-built or community tasks to save time and effort.
- Custom tasks can be created for unique requirements.
